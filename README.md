# Hello World!!!

Software developer here, My name is Mauricio Escalante and i guess this is my github profile's



## ðŸš€ About Me
I consider myself a full-stack developer. I enjoy exploring every area of software development I can: mobile with Android and Flutter, web with Angular, Express, and ASP.NET, desktop with WinForms, and DevOps with tools like Docker, CI/CD, GitHub, GitHub Actions, and some experience with cloud platforms such as AWS and DigitalOcean.

However, what truly defines me is my focus on software architecture. Throughout my short but intense career, I've realized that architecture is one of the most critical aspects of software development â€” and it has become my main area of interest.

## FAQ

#### Why donâ€™t your GitHub stats exactly reflect your experience?

I work â€” and continue to work â€” with private clients, so most of my main projects are not public and therefore donâ€™t count toward my GitHub stats. However, Iâ€™m planning to invest more time into personal projects to build up my portfolio.
